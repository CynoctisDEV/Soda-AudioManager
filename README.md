## Usage Guide

To use the plugin, call its functions in your scripts whenever you need to play, stop, or pause audio.

### Music Functions

**play music()**
```gdscript
SodaAudioManager.play_music(soundPath: String, loop: bool, fade: bool = false, fade_duration: float = 1.0)
```
*Plays background music from a specified file.*
- **soundPath:** Path to the audio file as a string (e.g., "res\://path/to/music.ogg").
- **loop:** Determines if the music loops (true/false). Only .ogg and .mp3 formats support looping; .wav files are not supported.
- **fade:** Enables a fade-in effect when starting the audio.

SodaAudioManager.stop_music(fade: bool, fade_duration: float = 1.0)
```
*Stops the currently playing music.*
- **fade:** If true, applies a fade-out effect before stopping.
- **fade_duration:** Sets the fade-out duration in seconds (default is 1.0).

### Sound Effects (SFX)

## Tips for Integration

If your game uses a configuration system with settings stored in a file, integrating it with `SodaAudioManager` is simple. Just call the update_volume() function and pass it the volume parameters from your global configuration node or from your game's interface buttons. Below I show an example where you store your game's volume values in a global script called **GlobalConfig**

**Example:**

```gdscript
SodaAudioManager.update_volume(GlobalConfig.musicVolume, GlobalConfig.uiVolume, GlobalConfig.sfxVolume)
```

This ensures consistency with your game’s audio settings.
